# org-daily-block.el

  Org-agenda is great. I use it on daily basis to remind myself what
  need to do.

  The thing that I am inspired by Org-agenda is the time grid.
  However, I am not a type of person who has many schedules to deal
  with. What I really like is just divided my day as three blocks.
